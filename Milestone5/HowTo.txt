For our automated tests we used a test suite called Selenium, which basically
allows you to record your mouse and keyboard actions within a website. In
other words it emulates a users actions that were prerecorded. The file
type produced a .side file. To begin using Selenium download the browser
extension Selenium IDE found on Selenium homepage. Next, set up our test
database MakeDB.sql which can be found in the makedatabase folder in our
github directory. Then start of MySQL server and your local Web Server that
can run PhP. Navigate to the homepage.php page and open the Selenium extension
from the browser application bar. Select the open project button in the upper
right hand corner of Selenium application and open AutomatedTests.side. Make
sure that each tests target matches the directory your local server is in if
not change it. Proceed to run each test, and actions should be emulated on the
webpage the name of each test is representative of the goal we want and the
running of the test will show us the result of the given condition.
